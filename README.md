# Sliding-menu
Small project with sliding menu created with Html, css and javascrpt.

This project has been created for people who would like to do sliding menu when user clicks on
button. You can do version in css only (with pseudo class focus) but then if user clicks button again
nothing will happen.

Hope you enjoy
